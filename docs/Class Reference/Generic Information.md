# Class Reference: Generic Information
## General information for all classes and types used in OKit

### C- Prefix VS O- Prefix
Class documentation is only available for classes with the O- Prefix.
The O- Prefix is for finalised classes that developers are meant to use in their projects. These classes are stable and simple to use.

The C- Prefix is for control/reference classes that are used internally by OKit, and are not meant to be used by developers. These classes are complicated, unstable, and lacking in functionality as they are meant to be strung together to form a larger class.

### Use
**Never** use C- Prefixed classes or types. Ignore them entirely and **Only** use O- Prefixed class.
O- Prefixed classes offer full functionality, ease of use, reliability, and documentation. There is never an instance to use C- Prefixed classes unless you are trying to remake a GUI element, which is highly advised against.
